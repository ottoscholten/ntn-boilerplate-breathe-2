    The aim is to further develop this set of liberating practices, together
    with all who wish to contribute. These practices will enable people in
    business to realize their companyâ€™s purpose, while creating as much value as
    possible, for the long run, across social, environmental and financial
    dimensions simultaneously. By servicing all stakeholders, we mean all life,
    the people on this planet, the ecosystem we live in, everything. We realize
    this is no small challenge. That is also why we will always be in
    development, be open to change, to continuously try and understand new
    perspectives & solutions.\

    \

    We aim at aligning all these different factors (purpose, capital, governance, culture, & structure) at the same time, because we believe we need to look at the entire picture of an organization when making design choices to the benefit of all stakeholders.\

    \

    Concretely we build a limited number of exceptional companies that become beacons of inspiration for other founders, entrepreneurs, and companies which will contribute to a much needed system change.
